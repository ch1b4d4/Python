One very important piece of information is the tread wear index, which indicates the tire’s resistance to tread wear. A tire with a grade of 200 should last twice as long, on average, as a tire with a grade of 100. A consumer organization wants to test the actual tread wear index of a brand name of tires that claims “graded 200” on the sidewall of the tire.
